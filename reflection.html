        <h3>WWW (What Went Well)</h3>
        <p>
            The actuality of the game turned out to be exactly what I've expected from the beginning of my planning.
            I was able to spawn random animals and obstacles randomly with barely any collisions by changing the delay rate and the 
            repeat rate of each object on the spawn manager in the hierarchy. Nevertheless, I was able to incorporate my learning
            and understanding from the previous 3 units from Unity into my game smoothly without any absurd or major bugs.
        </p>
        <h3>EBI (Even Better If)</h3>
        I believe the game would be a lot better if I can create a text on the screen of the game that records the player's highest 
        score, which ultimately encourages the player to play the game more frequently in order to try to break their own records.
