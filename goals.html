        <h3>There are 3 main goals that I plan to achieve throughout this project:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn how to code independently</li>
            <li>Learn to create a game through what I learned from unity tutorials</li>
            <li>Learn how to debug a game</li>

            <b>Follow-up:</b> Right now it is June 15th, 2023. Fortunately, I was able to accomplish all the fundamental goals 
            that I've set up for myself in the beginning of this project.
