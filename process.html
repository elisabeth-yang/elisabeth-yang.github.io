        <h1>Elisabeth's Process in Game Development</h1>
        <p>
            <h4>In the beginning of this project, I've went to the unity website and followed along with several units 
            on the basics of the coding with C#.</h4>

            The first Unit that I've learned is to program a vehicle moving side to side, that can bump or avoid obstacles.
            However, something I dilike about this unit is that the vehicle does not have boundaries, therefore, the vehicla can fall off the cliff
            whenever it wants to.<br><br>

            The second Unit that I have learned is to feed a various amount of animals food while they spawn at different positions at differnet time.<br><br>

            The third Unit has taught me how to jump over obstacles, add background music, add running/jumping/death movement onto the player to 
            increase the realty of the game. However, I dislike the part of the game where the player can only jump but cannot 
            move to the left, right, front, or back of the game -- it is too restricting. <br><br>

            Last, I've thought to create my own version of the game by combining what I dislike on each of the prototypes and what I can do to create a 
            game that I would prefer to play. Therefore, I've ended up with the idea to create a game that is quite similar with ny childhood game -- Subway Surfers.
