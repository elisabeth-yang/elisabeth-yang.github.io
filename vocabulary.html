            <h3>Access Modifiers:</h3>
            <b>private:</b> an access modifier, ca only be accessed within this class. Some are inherently private.<br>
            <b>public:</b> programmer can observe this class in other places.<br><br>

            <h3>structures:</h3>
            <b>float:</b> is added when it requires decimals<br>
            <b>int:</b> is added when it only requires integers.<br><br>
            
            <h3>Terminology and specific codes:</h3>
            <b>verticalInput = Input.GetAxis("Vertical"):</b> is used to only work when the left or right key is pressed, however, 
            it keyboard inputs can be changed due to the programmer's preference.<br>
            <b>horizontalInput = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"):</b> used to only work when the up or down key is pressed. If there is no input the function/program goes forever.<br>
            <b>Physics.gravity *= gravityModifier</b> is the same as Physics.gravity = Physics.gravity * gravityModifier.<br>
            <b>&&</b> is the C# version of "and"<br>
            <b>||</b> is the C# version of "or"<br>
            <b>Instantiate</b> is another way to say creating an object -- creating copies of objects that already exist.<br>
            <b>void</b> tells the computor that a specific function or method does not return anything, it just does what the programmers tell it to do inside the block of code.<br>
            <b>Prefabs</b> are prefabricated version of the object that one's using. In other words, the object can be reused, while the function of the objectt stays the same for each prefab.<br>
