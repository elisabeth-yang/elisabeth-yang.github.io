        <h1>The name of the game: ANIMALS ON THE LOOSE!</h1>
        <h2>How the game works</h2>
        <p>
            The player should avoid obstacles while aiming to feed the animals in order to bring them back to the nature.
        However, if you're in contact with the animal for more than three times, you'll get eaten by the animals. 
        In addition, I gaurantee that you do not want to get into an obstacle crash! Good luck bringing the animals back!

        <h3>How is my game different from what I've learned?</h3>
        <p>
            My game is definetly not the same with any of the games that I've learned from Unity although 
            I may have interpret some of the codes and game objects that Unity has provided for beginner students.
            I thought of the game right after I finished the third unit, where I am skilled with spawn manager, move forward, detect collisions, 
            destroy out of bounds, and player controller. By looking at the components that I've managed to advance in, 
            the first idea that popped into my mind was the game subway surfers.
